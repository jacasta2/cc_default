In this repo, I'll share my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling work with the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) from [UCI Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The dataset has demographic and six-month (Apr-Sep) credit-related information from customers and an additional feature that indicates whether these customers default on their Oct payment. The final purpose of this work is to come up with a model that predicts whether customers will default on their Oct payment. 

The EDA can be found in the folder **eda**. I hope to update this work with some feature engineering.

The modeling work can be found in the folder **ml**. I hope to update this work with a neural network model.

I highly appreciate feedback and you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://bit.ly/jaime-linkedin) any time. I'm also working on other projects. Check this out in my [personal website](https://bit.ly/jaime-website).

Thanks for reading!
