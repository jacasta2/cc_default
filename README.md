In this repo, I'll share my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling work with the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) from [UCI Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The EDA can be found in the folder **eda**. I hope to update this work with some feature engineering.

The modeling work can be found in the folder **ml**. I hope to update this work with a neural network model and a hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation to address overfitting.

I highly appreciate feedback and you can reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaime-data-science/) any time.

Thanks for reading!
