In this repo, I'll share my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and modeling work with the [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) from [UCI Machine Learning](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

The EDA can be found in the folder **eda**. I'll be sharing the modeling work in the coming days.
